For example, an input string of "&amp;amp;#xD84C;" would decode as U+D84C, which is an unpaired surrogate. Additionally, the decoder does not understand code points in the SMP unless they're represented as HTML-encoded surrogates, so the inputstring "&amp;#144308;" would result in the output string "&amp;#144308;".</summary>

This switch is meant to provide maximum interoperability when the decoder doesn't know which format the provider is using to generate the encoded string.</summary>
