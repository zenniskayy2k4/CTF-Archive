Some .NET Framework data providers may, but are not required to, use this information to optimize the performance of the command. When you specify <see cref="F:System.Data.CommandBehavior.SingleRow" /> with the <see cref="M:System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand.ExecuteReader" /> method of the <see cref="T:System.Data.OleDb.OleDbCommand" /> object, the .NET Framework Data Provider for OLE DB performs binding using the OLE DB <see langword="IRow" /> interface if it is available. Otherwise, it uses the <see langword="IRowset" /> interface. If your SQL statement is expected to return only a single row, specifying <see cref="F:System.Data.CommandBehavior.SingleRow" /> can also improve application performance. It is possible to specify <see langword="SingleRow" /> when executing queries that are expected to return multiple result sets.  In that case, where both a multi-result set SQL query and single row are specified, the result returned will contain only the first row of the first result set. The other result sets of the query will not be returned.</summary>

Rather than loading the entire row, <see langword="SequentialAccess" /> enables the <see langword="DataReader" /> to load data as a stream. You can then use the <see langword="GetBytes" /> or <see langword="GetChars" /> method to specify a byte location to start the read operation, and a limited buffer size for the data being returned.</summary>
