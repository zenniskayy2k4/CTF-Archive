# Desc

I have made a successful safe to use C compiler, try it once it's amazing and manages to be as fast as gcc in respect of runtime.

## Files

- `ghost_compiler` - The amazing and the most dashing compiler itself.

## Usage

- `./ghost_compiler filename.c` - The compiler is able to compile C binaries which can then be run, for starters -- try it with a basic "Hello World" program in respect of Brian Kernighan.

## Flag Format

`BITSCTF{...}`
