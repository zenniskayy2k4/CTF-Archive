# Cider Vault

The Storybook Workshop keeps magical story cards in a fragile old vault.
Caretakers can create cards, write words, read chapters, merge pages, and ring the moon bell.

The workshop software is old and quirky. Some card operations look safe, but hidden interactions can corrupt the vault state.
