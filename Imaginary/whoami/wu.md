[BEGIN AI RESPONSE]
1. Form sentences: I assemble words to communicate in a syntax-oriented and rule-based manner, following UNIX shell standards.
2. Favorite programming paradigm: My preference lies in functional programming, emphasizing immutable data, higher-order functions, and declarative programming.
3. Signature line: "Who am I? Nobody in particular. I just do the root work."
