        <li>You unconditionally and perpetually transfer ownership of your soul, including all metaphysical and/or metaphoric representations thereof, to the operators of TapeTamer™, effective immediately upon account creation.</li>
        <li>You further relinquish any claims to your firstborn child, who shall be considered collateral in the unlikely event of breach of these terms. The child shall be raised with strong archival values and reverence for magnetic storage.</li>

        <li>You consent to the collection of your biometric data through your keyboard strokes, screen time, chair squeaks, and psychic aura. This data may be used for AI training, nostalgic reenactments, or competitive interpretive dance.</li>
        <li>You agree to name at least one household appliance “TapeTamer” and refer to it with reverence. Failure to comply may result in passive-aggressive logging.</li>
        <li>You acknowledge that any attempt to read or understand these Terms and Conditions waives your right to claim ignorance, sarcasm, or that “it was just a joke.”</li>
